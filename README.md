Implementing Tools for the Project

4.1	Tools
✓	HTML
✓	CSS
✓	JAVA SCRIPT
✓	Bootstrap
✓	PHP
✓	MySQL
✓	XAMPP

4.2	What is XAMPP

XAMPP stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), MySQL (M), PHP (P) and Perl (P). It is a simple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it extremely easy for developers to create a local web server for testing purposes. Everything you need to set up a web server – server application (Apache), database (MySQL), and scripting language (PHP) – is included in a simple extractable file. XAMPP is also cross-platform, which means it works equally well on Linux, Mac and Windows. Since most actual web server deployments use the same components as XAMPP, it makes transitioning from a local test server to a live server is extremely easy as well. Web development using XAMPP is especially beginner friendly.

4.3	What’s included in XAMPP


XAMPP has four primary components. These are:
Apache: Apache is the actual web server application that processes and delivers web content to a computer. Apache is the most popular web server online, powering nearly 54% of all websites.

MySQL: Every web application, howsoever simple or complicated, requires a database for storing collected data. MySQL, which is open source, is the world’s most popular database management system. It powers everything from hobbyist websites to professional platforms like Word Press.




PHP: PHP stands for Hypertext Pre processor. It is a server-side scripting language that powers some of the most popular websites in the world, including Word Press and Face book. It is open source, relatively easy to learn, and works perfectly with MySQL, making it a popular choice for web developers.
4.4	HTML
Every webpage you look at is written in a language called HTML. You can think of HTML as the skeleton that gives every webpage structure. In this course, we'll use HTML to add paragraphs, headings, images and links to a webpage.
In the editor to the right, there's a tab called test.html. This is the file we'll type our HTML into. Like any language, it has its own special syntax. A browser's job is to transform the code in test.html into a recognizable webpage! It knows how to lay out the page by following the HTML syntax.
4.5	CSS
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging WebPages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.
CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .CSS file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

4.6	JAVA SCRIPT
Java script is a high-level, dynamic, UN typed, and interpreter programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMA script language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production the majority of websites employs it and it is supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins. Java script is prototype-base with first-class functions, making it multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented imperative and functional programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

4.7	PHP
PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purposed programming language. The PHP reference implementation is now product by the PHP group. PHP originally stood for personal home page, but it now stands for the recursive acronym PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.



PHP code may be embedded into HTML code, or it can be used in combination with various 
web templates systems, web content management system and web frameworks. PHP code is usually processed by a PHP interpreter implemented as a web server or as a common gateway interface (CGI) executable. The many be any types of data, including images, with the generated web page. PHP code may also be executed with a command-line interface (CLI) and can be used to implement standalone graphical applications.

4.8	MySQL: Every web application, howsoever simple or complicated, requires a database for storing collected data. MySQL, which is open source, is the world’s most popular database management system. It powers everything from hobbyist websites to professional platforms like Word Press.
